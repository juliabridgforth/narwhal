<p>Often dubbed the unicorns of the sea, narwhals are strange and beautiful creatures with long tusks protruding from
    their heads. Members of the population of more than 80,000 can weigh up to 4,200 pounds and grow as long as 17 feet
    in length. Read on to learn more about these fascinating animals.</p>

<p>The narwhal tusk—most commonly found on males—is actually an enlarged tooth with sensory capability and up to 10
    million nerve endings inside. Some narwhals have up to two tusks, while others have none. The spiraled tusk juts
    from the head and can grow as long at 10 feet.</p>

<p>Unlike some whale species that migrate, narwhals spend their lives in the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway
    and Russia. Most narwhals winter for up to five months under sea ice in the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait area.</p>
